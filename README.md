# PyCity Schools Analysis

## Background

The school board has hired our firm to complete an analysis of the PyCity schools.  Following our analysis, it was brought to our attention that the data for the entire Ninth Grade at Thomas High Schools had been corrupted or altered.  In the final adjusted analysis, the Thomas High School data has been altered to reflect the scores of the 10th, 11th, and 12th grade testing scores only.  

## Overview
Adjustment of the Thomas High School data allows for an accurate portrayal of the testing statistics for both, Thomas High School and the District as a whole.
